# 3-DOF-Robotic-Arm
The 3-Degree-of-Freedom (DOF) Autonomous Robotic Arm is a compact and efficient robotic system designed for precision pick-and-place operations. The system integrates MATLAB for trajectory planning, while Arduino IDE is used for real-time control and programming of the servo motors.
